P9: Create a row level trigger for the CUSTOMERS table that
would fire INSERT or UPDATE or DELETE operations performed on the
CUSTOMERS table. This trigger will display the salary difference
between the old values and new values.

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,    
    customer_name VARCHAR2(100),    
    salary NUMBER(10, 2)            
);

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER customers_salary_difference
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON CUSTOMERS
  FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  -- For INSERT: No previous value, so just display the new salary
  IF INSERTING THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Inserted: Customer ' || :NEW.customer_id || ' has a salary of ' || :NEW.salary);
  END IF;

  -- For DELETE: Display the old salary
  IF DELETING THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deleted: Customer ' || :OLD.customer_id || ' had a salary of ' || :OLD.salary);
  END IF;

  -- For UPDATE: Display the difference between old and new salary
  IF UPDATING THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Updated: Customer ' || :OLD.customer_id || ' salary changed from ' || :OLD.salary || ' to ' || :NEW.salary);
  END IF;
END;

-- Sample Data
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (customer_id, customer_name, salary)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 60000);

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (customer_id, customer_name, salary)
VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 45000);

-- Insert a new customer
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (customer_id, customer_name, salary)
VALUES (3, 'Alice Brown', 55000);

-- Update an existing customer's salary
UPDATE CUSTOMERS
SET salary = 65000
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- Delete a customer
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE customer_id = 2;
