Write a database trigger on Library table. The System should keep track of the records that are
being updated or deleted. The old value of updated or deleted records should be added in
Library_Audit table.

CREATE TABLE Library (
    Book_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR2(100),
    Author VARCHAR2(100),
    Publisher VARCHAR2(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Library_Audit (
    Audit_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    Book_ID NUMBER,
    Title VARCHAR2(100),
    Author VARCHAR2(100),
    Publisher VARCHAR2(100),
    Operation VARCHAR2(10),
    Change_Date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);

CREATE SEQUENCE Audit_ID_Seq
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1
NOCACHE;

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER before_update_library
BEFORE UPDATE ON Library
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Library_Audit (Audit_ID, Book_ID, Title, Author, Publisher, Operation, Change_Date)
    VALUES (Audit_ID_Seq.NEXTVAL, :OLD.Book_ID, :OLD.Title, :OLD.Author, :OLD.Publisher, 'UPDATE', SYSDATE);
END;

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER before_delete_library
BEFORE DELETE ON Library
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Library_Audit (Audit_ID, Book_ID, Title, Author, Publisher, Operation, Change_Date)
    VALUES (Audit_ID_Seq.NEXTVAL, :OLD.Book_ID, :OLD.Title, :OLD.Author, :OLD.Publisher, 'DELETE', SYSDATE);
END;

after:
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER after_update_library
AFTER UPDATE ON Library
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Library_Audit (Audit_ID, Book_ID, Title, Author, Publisher, Operation, Change_Date)
    VALUES (Audit_ID_Seq.NEXTVAL, :OLD.Book_ID, :OLD.Title, :OLD.Author, :OLD.Publisher, 'UPDATE', SYSDATE);
END;

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER after_delete_library
AFTER DELETE ON Library
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Library_Audit (Audit_ID, Book_ID, Title, Author, Publisher, Operation, Change_Date)
    VALUES (Audit_ID_Seq.NEXTVAL, :OLD.Book_ID, :OLD.Title, :OLD.Author, :OLD.Publisher, 'DELETE', SYSDATE);
